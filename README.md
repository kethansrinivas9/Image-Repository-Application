# Image Repository Application
This is a Single Page Application that is created using MySQL, ExpressJS, AngularJS and NodeJS. This application is developed as part of [Shopify Internship challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZKRywXQLZWOqVOHC4JkF3LqdpO3Llpfk_CkZPR8bjak/edit#).


The application has the following features:
1. Upload one/bulk images
2. Display images
3. Load images on scroll to reduce the latency in displaying them
4. Dockerized the application by splitting it into two containers, one for frontend and the other for backend

1. Add Authentication for the application
2. Display images based on their visibility as public/private
3. Delete the images
